MolScaling Documentation
========================

This is a documentation for easy-to-use investigation of the neural scaling laws of Molecular Representation Learning (MRL). 
It contains detailed description of molecular dataset classes and model classes. It also provides 
several tutorials allowing for users to implement our results and build upon our code. The source code is provided in our 
GitHub repository (https://github.com/Data-reindeer/NSL_MRL).
